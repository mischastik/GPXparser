# GPXparser
A simple and very limited library collection of tools to load GPX files, compute some statistics and display them.

**RenderTrack** is a command line application that renders GPX tracks onto Open Street Maps tiles and generates a bitmap image of the respective map with the track rendered onto it.

Now with .NET10.0, Visual Studio Code and Linux support (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and later versions).
